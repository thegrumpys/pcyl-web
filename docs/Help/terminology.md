## Terminology

The following terms have special meanings used in the context of this program.

INDEPENDENT VARIABLES &nbsp;  (inputs, design parameters)   
The independent variables are the inputs of the design equations.
They are the quantities on the right hand side of the equals sign that
can be arbitrarily selected by the designer or search routine. 
Once values are selected for each independent variable, 
the design iscompletely determined. 
For independent variables, a FIX operation reduces the computational demand 
of the numerical search problem.

DEPENDENT VARIABLES &nbsp;  (outputs, state variables)   
The dependent variables are the outputs of the design equations.
They are the quantities on the left hand side of the equal sign.
Frequently, dependent variables are measures of the performance of a given
design and can be thought of as indicating the "state" of the design. 
A SEARCH operation is required to establish appropriate values of the
independent variables to produce the desired value of a FIXed dependent
variable.  A FIX operation on a dependent variable increases the
computational demand of the numerical search problem.

CALCULATION INPUTS &nbsp;  (constants)   
Referred to as "constants" in earlier versions of the software, 
Calculation Inputs are inputs to the design equations and are adjustable by the
user, but are not manipulated by the search algorithm or subject to FIX or constraints. 
Calculation Inputs frequently represent material properties or other physical constants.

CONSTRAINTS   
Constraints are one sided boundaries that represent goals for the design
problem.  Either dependent or independent variables may be constrained to
be greater than or less than a simple constant or a functionally
determined quantity such as a different dependent or independent
variable.  The documentation section titled "FUNCTION" provides more
information on this subject.

CONSTRAINT VIOLATIONS   
A constraint violation represents the difference between the current
value of a given variable and its corresponding constraint level.  By
convention, negative values represent constraint satisfaction, positive
values represent constraint violation.

FEASIBLE REGION   
A feasible region may be formed within the boundaries represented by the
various constraints on the design problem.  If a given design satisfies
all the constraints, it is said to be "feasible" or in the "feasible
region".  If the constraint levels are set such that the constraints
overlap, no solution that satisfies the design equations and the
constraints simultaneously can be found.  The search will terminate with
multiple constraints violated.  In this case, there is no feasible
region.

When faced with the situation where no feasible solution is available,
the designer must restructure the problem or his goals in some way to
permit the desired solution.  Perhaps the solution is to use a stronger
material.  This can be represented by changing a material constant and
re-executing the search.  Perhaps use of the TRADE feature is appropriate.

OBJECTIVE FUNCTION   
The objective function constitutes the numerical search problem.  It is
formed as a blend of violated constraints, dependent variable FIX
violations and in the case of the SEEK feature, a "merit function" that
represents the variable under investigation.  The search algorithm works
to drive the objective function to the lowest value possible.

PREFERENCES &nbsp; (Internal Variables)   
Preference settings control the operation of the program.  They have no
direct meaning to the design problem.  For further information, refer to 
the Help sections on Preferences and Search.

PROPERTIES
It is possible to store a series of text strings with a design in order 
to carry descriptive information. 
The File : Properties menu is used to establish a set of label - value 
pairs where both the text of the label and the text of the value are set 
by the user.

EQUATION SETS   
The ODO:Platform software allows for multiple sets of design equations named
EQNSET1, EQNSET2, ...  etc.  For example, 
EQNSET1 can handle compression springs 
while EQNSET2 handles extension springs and
EQNSET3 handles torsion springs. 
The simplest way to use a different equation set is to open a
sample design that uses that equation set. 

SEARCH ROUTINES   
The ODO:Platform software is configured to handle multiple numerical search algorithms
named SEARCH1, SEARCH2, ...  etc. 
The current software release supplies only one such numerical search algorithm.
